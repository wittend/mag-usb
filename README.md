# mag-usb

Version: 0.0.4

mag-usb is a Linux command‑line utility for reading a PNI RM3100 3‑axis magnetometer via a USB‑to‑I²C adapter (Pololu 5396/5397). It outputs time‑stamped magnetic field vectors and supports optional configuration via a simple TOML file.

The RM3100 boards were developed for the HamSCI Personal Space Weather Station (PSWS) TangerineSDR and Grape monitors, but mag-usb can be used as a standalone low‑cost geomagnetic field logger.

Key points:
- Portable C (no heavyweight dependencies).
- Designed to use the Pololu Isolated USB‑to‑I²C Adapter family.
- Works on typical Linux hosts with USB 2.0. Raspberry Pi‑class devices may work but are not the current target.
- Windows is not supported. macOS may work but is untested.

## Features
- Reads RM3100 magnetometer X/Y/Z and prints JSON lines including an RFC‑2822 timestamp.
- Configurable cycle counts, gains, and sampling parameters.
- Optional orientation translations in 90° increments about X/Y/Z, set in config.toml.
- Convenience flag to print current settings (`-P`).
- Optional diagnostics: verify devices, scan I²C bus, etc.

## Build (using CLion profiles or plain CMake)

CLion (recommended):
- Open the project; CLion generates Debug and Release profiles under cmake-build-debug and cmake-build-release.
- Build the target `mag-usb` from the chosen profile.

Plain CMake:
```
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build --target mag-usb
```

## Quick start
- Connect the Pololu USB‑to‑I²C adapter and your RM3100 board.
- Run with your adapter device path (default is `/dev/ttyACM0`):
```
./build/mag-usb -O /dev/ttyACM0 -Q
```
Flags shown here:
- `-O` sets the adapter device path.
- `-Q` verifies adapter presence.

To print current settings (and exit):
```
./build/mag-usb -P
```
If a `config.toml` file is present in the working directory, its values will be shown/used; otherwise reasonable defaults are used.

## Configuration
A simple TOML configuration file is supported. By default the program looks for `config.toml` in the current working directory. See:
- docs/Configuration.md — all keys, defaults, and examples.
- docs/Orientation-and-Axes.md — how the 90° orientation translations work.

Example orientation section:
```
[mag_orientation]
mag_translate_x = 90
mag_translate_y = 0
mag_translate_z = -90
```
Allowed values: `-180, -90, 0, 90, 180` (±180 are equivalent). Invalid/missing values default to 0.

## Output format
Each line is JSON with at least:
```
{ "ts": "DD Mon YYYY HH:MM:SS", "x": NNN.NNN, "y": NNN.NNN, "z": NNN.NNN }
```
- Units: nanoTesla (nT)
- Orientation translations are applied before printing.
See docs/Data-Format.md for more detail.

## Running tests (CTest)
The `i2c-pololu` unit tests are integrated with CTest.

Enable/Build/Run:
```
cmake -S . -B build -DBUILD_TESTING=ON
cmake --build build --target i2c-pololu-tests
(cd build && ctest --output-on-failure)
```
Run the test executable directly:
```
./build/i2c-pololu-tests
```
